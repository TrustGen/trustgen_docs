# Welcome to TrustGen Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **TrustGen**. This documentation site contains comprehensive guides and information about our projects and tools. 



## What's TrustGen

Recognizing that current benchmarks focus narrowly on specific model categories and lack a dynamic nature, we introduce TrustGen, a comprehensive and adaptive benchmark for evaluating GenFMs across multiple dimensions of trustworthiness.
